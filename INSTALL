Dependencies
------------------------------------------------------------------

Building halide requires at least llvm 3.2, along with the matching
version of clang. llvm-config and clang must be somewhere in the
path. If your OS does not have packages for llvm-3.2, you can find
binaries for it at http://llvm.org/releases/download.html. Download an
appropriate package and then either install it, or at least put the
bin subdirectory in your path. (This works well on OS X and Ubuntu.)

If you want to build it yourself, first check it out from subversions:

svn co https://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/llvm/branches/release_32 llvm3.2
svn co https://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/cfe/branches/release_32 llvm3.2/tools/clang

Then build it like so:

cd llvm3.2
./configure --enable-optimized --enable-assertions --with-clang --enable-targets=x86,arm,nvptx
make -j8

Then finally tell Halide's Makefile about it like so:

export LLVM_CONFIG=<path to llvm>/Release+Asserts/bin/llvm_config
export CLANG=<path to llvm>/Release+Asserts/bin/clang

If you want a newer llvm, then trunk llvm should also work.

Building Halide
------------------------------------------------------------------

With LLVM_CONFIG and CLANG set (or the appropriate llvm-config and
clang in your path), you should be able to just run 'make' in this
directory. 'make tests' will run the JIT test suite, and 'make
test_apps' will make sure all the apps compile and run (but won't
check their output).

There is no 'make install' or 'make distrib' yet. If you want to make
an install package, grab bin/libHalide.a, bin/libHalide.so, and
include/Halide.h.

------------------------------------------------------------------
Building Halide with Native Client support
------------------------------------------------------------------

Compiling to Native Client is an experimental feature. JIT compilation
is not supported, only generating object files. Only native targets
are supported, not Portable Native Client (PNaCl). The PNaCl llvm tree
is used as it contains required llvm headers and libraries for compiling
to the Native Client target.

In order to build Halide with Native Client support, one will need the
PNaCl llvm tree from:
    http://git.chromium.org/native_client/pnacl-llvm.git

To enable all Halide targets, configure it like so:
    ./configure --enable-assertions --enable-optimized --enable-targets=arm,x86,nvptx

It will possibly be helpful to get the entire dev tree for
PNaCl. Documentation for this is here:
    http://www.chromium.org/nativeclient/pnacl/developing-pnacl

A standard Native Client tree will also be required for the C library
includes to build the runtime initial modules. (Only glibc has been
tried, not newlib.) Likely the easiest way to get this is to download
the Native Client SDK from here:
    https://developers.google.com/native-client/sdk/

Once The Native Client prerequisites are in place, set the following
variables (on the command line or by editing the Makefile):

 Point LLVM_CONFIG to the llvm-config that lives in your pnacl llvm
 build. E.g:

  % export LLVM_CONFIG=<path-to-Halide>/llvm/pnacl-llvm/Release+Asserts/bin/llvm-config

 Change WITH_NATIVE_CLIENT to "true" (or any non-empty value):
 
  % export WITH_NATIVE_CLIENT=true

 Point NATIVE_CLIENT_X86_INCLUDE and NATIVE_CLIENT_ARM_INCLUDE to the
 appropriate include directories within the native client SDK. E.g.:

  % export NATIVE_CLIENT_X86_INCLUDE=~/nacl_sdk/pepper_26/toolchain/linux_x86_glibc/x86_64-nacl/include/

With these variables set, run make. This will build a Halide lib
capable of generating native client objects. Neither the tests nor
most of the apps Makefiles have been updated to work with cross
compilation however. Try the app HelloNacl for a theoretically-working
example.

ARM native client has not been tested yet.
