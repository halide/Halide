# There are two sorts of Python Extensions that we can produce for a Halide Generator
# written in C++:
#
# - One that is essentially the 'native code' output of a Generator, wrapped with enough CPython
#   glue code to make it callable from Python. This is analogous to the usual Generator output
#   when building a C++ codebase, and is the usual mode used for distribution of final product;
#   these correspond to 'ahead-of-time' (AOT) code generation. The resulting code has no dependency
#   on libHalide. We'll refer to this sort of extension as an "AOT extension".
#
# - One that essentially *the Generator itself*, wrapped in CPython glue code to make it callable
#   from Python at Halide compilation time. This is analogous to the (rarely used) GeneratorStub
#   code that can be used to compose multiple Generators together. The resulting extension *does*
#   depend on libHalide, and can be used in either JIT or AOT mode for compilation.
#   We'll refer to this sort of extension as a "Stub extension".
#
# For testing purposes here, we don't bother using distutils/setuptools to produce a properly-packaged
# Python extension; rather, we simply produce a .so file with the correct name exported, and ensure
# it's in the PYTHONPATH when testing.
#
# In our build files here, we build both kinds of extension for every Generator in the generators/
# directory (even though not all are used). As a simplistic way to distinguish between the two
# sorts of extensions, we use the unadorned Generator name for AOT extensions, and the Generator name
# suffixed with "_stub" for Stub extensions. (TODO: this is unsatisfyingly hackish; better suggestions
# would be welcome.)
