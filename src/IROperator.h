 *
 * The weight is treated as its own type and must be float or an

 * x and y if they are integer, or converted to float if they are
 * float. Integer weights are converted to float via division by the

 * 1.0f, and an error may be signaled if it is not provably so. (clamp
 * operators can be added to provide proof. Currently an error is only
 * signalled for constant weights.)
 *
 * For integer linear interpolation, out of range values cannot be
 * represented. In particular, weights that are conceptually less than
 * 0 or greater than 1.0 are not representable. As such the result is
 * always between x and y (inclusive of course). For lerp with
 * floating-point values and floating-point weight, the full range of

 *
 * Ordering is not required between zero_val and one_val:
 *     lerp(42, 69, .5f) == lerp(69, 42, .5f) == 56
 *
 * Results for integer types are for exactly rounded arithmetic. As
 * such, there are cases where 16-bit and float differ because 32-bit
 * floating-point (float) does not have enough precision to produce
 * the exact result. (Likely true for 32-bit integer
 * vs. double-precision floating-point as well.)

 * generated, but it is also possible the compiler will crash.) The
 * promised bound is used in bounds inference so it will allow
 * satisfying bounds checks as well as possibly aiding optimization.
 *
 * unsafe_promise_clamped returns its first argument, the Expr 'value'
 *
 * This is a very easy way to make Halide generate erroneous code if
 * the bound promises is not kept. Use sparingly when there is no
 * other way to convey the information to the compiler and it is
 * required for a valuable optimization.
 *
 * Unsafe promises can be checked by turning on
 * Target::CheckUnsafePromises. This is intended for debugging only.
