 AssociativeOp assoc = {
    min(x, y),

 * For unary operator, 'x' is not set, i.e. it will be a pair of empty string
 * and undefined Expr: {"", Expr()}. 'op' will only contain the 'y' term in
 * this case. For example, min(g(r.x), 4), will be represented as:
 \code
 AssociativeOp assoc = {
    y,
    0,
    {"", Expr()},
    {"y", min(g(r.x), 4)},

 * Given an update definition of a Func 'f', determine its equivalent associative
 * binary/unary operator if there is any. For an associative tuple update, this

 * element in the update definition. This will also compute the commutativity
 * of the associative update definition. If the update definition is failed to
 * be proven as associative, neither the AssociativeOps vector nor the
 * 'is_commutative' result is valid.
 *
 * For instance, f(x) = min(f(x), g(r.x)) will return true for associativity and
 * commutativity and it will also return {{min(_x_0, _y_0), +inf, {_x_0, f(x)},
 * {_y_0, g(r.x)}}}, where the first Expr is the equivalent binary operator,
 * the second Expr is identity of the binary operator, the third and the last
 * pair contain the corresponding definition of each variable in the binary operator.
 *
 * Note that even though f(x) = f(x) is associative, we'll treat it as non-associative
 * since it doesn't really make any sense to do any associative reduction on that
 * particular update definition.
