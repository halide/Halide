 * expression is placed in the vector give as the third argument.
 * Wildcards require the types to match. For the type bits and width,
 * a -1 indicates "match anything". So an Int(8, -1) will match 8-bit
 * integer vectors of any width (including scalars), and a UInt(-1,
 * -1) will match any unsigned integer type.
 *
 * For example:
 \code
 Expr x = Variable::make(Int(32), "*");
 match(x + x, 3 + (2*k), result)
 \endcode
 * should return true, and set result[0] to 3 and
 * result[1] to 2*k.

 \code

 match(x*(x + 1), a*(a + b), result)
 \endcode
