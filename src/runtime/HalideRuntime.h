/** \file
 *
 * This file exports all routines which can be replaced by an
 * application hosting code generated by %Halide. These are used when
 * doing Ahead Of Time (AOT) compilation and must be supplied to the
 * linker to override a routine. I.e., just define your own version of
 * any of these functions with extern "C" linkage, and it should
 * replace the default one.
 *
 * When doing Just In Time (JIT) compilation methods on the Func being
 * compiled must be called instead. The corresponding methods are
 * documented below.
 *
 * All of these functions take a "void *user_context" parameter as their
 * first argument; if the Halide kernel that calls back to any of these
 * funcions has been defined with a "__user_context" parameter XXXXXXXX,
 * then the value of that pointer passed from the code that calls the
 * Halide kernel is piped through to the function.
 *
 * Some of these are also useful to call when using the default
 * implementation. E.g. halide_shutdown_thread_pool.
 *
 * Note that some linker setups may not respect the override you
 * provide. E.g. if the override is in a shared library and the halide
 * object files are linked directly into the output, the builtin
 * versions of the runtime functions will be called. See your linker
 * documentation for more details. On Linux, LD_DYNAMIC_WEAK=1 may
 * help.
