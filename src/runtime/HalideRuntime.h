 *
 * This file declares the routines used by Halide internally in its
 * runtime. On platforms that support weak linking, these can be
 * replaced with user-defined versions by defining an extern "C"
 * function with the same name and signature.
 *
 * When doing Just In Time (JIT) compilation methods on the Func being
 * compiled must be called instead. The corresponding methods are
 * documented below.
 *
 * All of these functions take a "void *user_context" parameter as their
 * first argument; if the Halide kernel that calls back to any of these
 * functions has been compiled with the UserContext feature set on its Target,
 * then the value of that pointer passed from the code that calls the
 * Halide kernel is piped through to the function.
 *
 * Some of these are also useful to call when using the default
 * implementation. E.g. halide_shutdown_thread_pool.
 *
 * Note that even on platforms with weak linking, some linker setups
 * may not respect the override you provide. E.g. if the override is
 * in a shared library and the halide object files are linked directly
 * into the output, the builtin versions of the runtime functions will
 * be called. See your linker documentation for more details. On
 * Linux, LD_DYNAMIC_WEAK=1 may help.
