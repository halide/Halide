/** \file
 *
 * This file exports all routines which can be replaced by an
 * application hosting code generated by %Halide. These are used when
 * doing Ahead Of Time (AOT) compilation and must be supplied to the
 * linker to override a routine. I.e., just define your own version of
 * any of these functions with extern "C" linkage, and it should
 * replace the default one.
 *
 * When doing Just In Time (JIT) compilation methods on the Func being
 * compiled must be called instead. The corresponding methods are
 * documented below.
 *
 * All of these functions take a "void *user_context" parameter as their
 * first argument; if the Halide kernel that calls back to any of these
 * functions has been compiled with the UserContext feature set on its Target,
 * then the value of that pointer passed from the code that calls the
 * Halide kernel is piped through to the function.
 *
 * Some of these are also useful to call when using the default
 * implementation. E.g. halide_shutdown_thread_pool.
 *
 * Note that some linker setups may not respect the override you
 * provide. E.g. if the override is in a shared library and the halide
 * object files are linked directly into the output, the builtin
 * versions of the runtime functions will be called. See your linker
 * documentation for more details. On Linux, LD_DYNAMIC_WEAK=1 may
 * help.

    These structs must be robust across different compilers and settings; when
    modifying them, strive for the following rules:

    1) All fields are explicitly sized. I.e. must use int32_t and not "int"
    2) All fields must land on an alignment boundary that is the same as their size
    3) Explicit padding is added to make that so
    4) The sizeof the struct is padded out to a multiple of the largest natural size thing in the struct
    5) don't forget that 32 and 64 bit pointers are different sizes
