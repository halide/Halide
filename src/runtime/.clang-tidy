# In clang-tidy-11 (or maybe clang-tidy-12) you can use
#
#  InheritParentConfig: true
#
# to just inherit from parent .clang-tidy files. Alas,
# that isn't available in clang-tidy-10, so we must make copies
# where specialization is needed.

#
# The desired change here is just to remove bugprone-sizeof-expression.
