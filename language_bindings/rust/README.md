## FAQ

### Where are the makefiles or cmakelists?
The halide_build crate contains that functionality, the usage can be seen in the iir_blur example app build.rs file
### Why are halide_runtime test located in a separate crate?
The halide_runtime crate requires being linked to a libhalide.a to perform meaningful tests.
