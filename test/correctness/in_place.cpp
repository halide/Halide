    // scalar code). This test does not exist in order to encourage
    // you to use this behavior. This just makes sure the expected
    // thing happens if someone is mad enough to write this.

    // and then have an update step that loads the existing value and
    // stores it again unchanged at those pixels you don't want to
    // modify. However, this exists if you really need it. E.g. if one
    // page in the middle of your halide_buffer_t is memprotected as read
    // only and you can't store to it safely, or if you have some
    // weird memory mapping or race condition for which loading then
    // storing the same value has undesireable side-effects.
