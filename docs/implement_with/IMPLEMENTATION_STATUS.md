# `implement_with` — Implementation Status

**Branch:** `alexreinking/implement_with` (worktree at
`/var/home/alex/dev/Halide/implement_with`)
**Current phase:** Phase 4 in progress. Spec-pipeline lowering entry
point and region locator landed; structural matcher itself is the next
piece.
**Last updated:** 2026-05-25 (session 5)

This file is the single source of truth for *where we are*. The design doc
([`DESIGN.md`](DESIGN.md)) is the spec; this file is the trace. Update at
the end of every session.

## Session 5 — what landed (Phase 4 kick-off, 2026-05-25)

### Doc changes (1 commit)

- **DESIGN.md / IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md / DECISIONS.md** — Phase 4
  case-study list expanded from three entries to four. PTX MMA on
  CUDA (NVPTX tensor cores) added as the LLVM-backed-GPU validation
  case. DECISIONS.md gets a new "Phase 4 case-study set" entry with
  the rationale and rejected alternatives (three-cases-only;
  pick-one-of-HVX-AMX; string-y GPU). DESIGN.md changelog updated.

### Source changes (3 commits)

- **`src/Lower.h` / `src/Lower.cpp`** — exposed
  `Internal::lower_to_canonical_form` via Lower.h. Moved out of the
  anonymous namespace and dropped the internal `LoweringLogger`
  parameter (now instantiated inside the function). `lower_impl`
  moved into its own anonymous namespace. No-behavior-change
  refactor.
- **`src/ImplementWithMatcher.h` / `src/ImplementWithMatcher.cpp`**
  (new) — defines two pieces of matcher infrastructure:
    - `Internal::lower_spec_to_canonical_form(spec, target)` — spec-
      side counterpart of `lower_impl`'s pre-canonical-form prefix.
      Runs the same setup (`deep_copy + build_environment`,
      `lower_target_query_ops`, `strictify_float`,
      `lock_loop_levels`, `wrap_func_calls`, `realization_order`,
      `simplify_specializations`) then calls
      `lower_to_canonical_form`. Intentional omission vs.
      `lower_impl`: does *not* call
      `apply_implement_with_directives` (specs cannot themselves
      carry instructions).
    - `Internal::find_implement_with_loop(stmt, func, stage, var)`
      — IRVisitor that locates the `For` node whose stage-qualified
      name is `<func>.s<stage>.<var>` in a canonical-form Stmt.
      Returns undefined if not found.
- **`src/CMakeLists.txt`** — `ImplementWithMatcher.{h,cpp}` registered
  alphabetically (between `ImageParam` and `InferArguments`).
- **`test/correctness/implement_with_phase4.cpp`** (new) — 4 sub-tests:
    - `test_spec_lowers_to_nonempty_stmt` — lowers an Instruction's
      spec through the new entry point and verifies the lowered
      Stmt is non-trivial and mentions the output Func's name.
    - `test_use_site_pipeline_still_compiles` — regression check
      that the Phase 3 lowering path is intact.
    - `test_find_implement_with_loop_returns_for_node` — locator
      finds the expected For in a spec lowered with explicit
      `Var("i")`.
    - `test_find_implement_with_loop_returns_undefined_when_missing`.
- **`test/correctness/CMakeLists.txt`** — phase4 test registered;
  its target adds `${Halide_SOURCE_DIR}/src` to the include path
  because it calls `Internal::` API directly.

### Known noise (not a regression)

- Lowering a spec pipeline emits warnings of the form
  `"It is meaningless to bound dimension v0 of function a to be
  within [0, 8] because the function is scheduled inline."` These
  fire on spec-pattern input Funcs which are inlined by default but
  carry `bound()` from the contract. Same warnings fire on the
  Phase 3 use-site path. Cosmetic only; could be suppressed for
  spec lowering in a follow-up (e.g. by suppressing inline-bound
  warnings on spec-pattern Funcs, or by scheduling spec inputs
  `compute_root()` before lowering).

## Session 4 — what landed (pre-Phase-4 setup, 2026-05-25)

### Source changes (committed, 1 commit)

- **`src/Lower.cpp`** — extracted `Internal::lower_to_canonical_form`
  from `lower_impl`. No-behavior-change refactor; the function owns
  every Stmt-transforming pass from `schedule_functions` through
  `strip_asserts`, with `find_intrinsics` and AMX
  `extract_tile_operations` *inside* the prefix. `lower_impl` now
  calls it. User `custom_passes` and backend offloading still run
  inline in `lower_impl` after it returns.

### Resolved open questions

- **OQ#5 (canonicalization prefix)** — pinned at the body of
  `lower_to_canonical_form`. v1 makes no stability promise; in-tree
  intrinsic catalogs stay in sync by construction. Cut is *before*
  custom_passes (so canonical form is a property of (env, Target)
  alone, not the user's local toolbox) and *before* backend
  offloading. See
  [DECISIONS.md](DECISIONS.md#oq5-canonicalization-prefix) for the
  four constraints that jointly point at this cut.

### Doc changes

- **DESIGN.md §4.4** rewritten — replaced the prose bullet list with
  the actual ordered pass sequence inside `lower_to_canonical_form`.
  OQ#5 marked resolved with a link to DECISIONS.
- **DECISIONS.md** — new OQ#5 entry with the four-constraint analysis
  and the alternatives considered (cut earlier / at
  `set_conceptual_code_stmt` / post-offload / versioned).
- DESIGN.md changelog updated.

### Tests

| Path                                                  | Status | Notes |
|-------------------------------------------------------|--------|-------|
| `test/correctness/implement_with_phase1.cpp`          | Passes | Unchanged. |
| `test/correctness/implement_with_phase2.cpp`          | Passes | Unchanged. |
| `test/correctness/implement_with_phase3.cpp`          | Passes | Unchanged. |
| Sample of unrelated correctness tests                 | Passes | bounds, simplify, vectorize_varying_allocation_size, compute_at_split_rvar, memoize — exercising the any_memoized path through the refactor. |

---

## Phase 3 — what landed (session 3, 2026-05-25)

### Source changes (committed)

- **`src/ApplyImplementWith.h`** / **`src/ApplyImplementWith.cpp`** (new) —
  declares and defines `Internal::apply_implement_with_directives(env,
  target)`, the lowering-time pass that:
    1. Errors if any of `instr.required_features()` are missing from the
       compile Target.
    2. For each `ImplementWithDirective` on any stage of any Func in the
       deep-copied env, calls `instr.spec()`, identifies user Funcs
       corresponding to spec output (primary) and inputs (by Func name in
       the user's env), and transfers `FuncSchedule::bounds()` entries
       with a *positional* spec-arg → user-arg rename.
    3. Detects constant-extent / constant-min conflicts between a
       transferred bound and a pre-existing user bound, and errors with
       a message that names both values, the instruction, the var, and
       the user Func.
- **`src/Lower.cpp`** — calls `apply_implement_with_directives` after
  `lock_loop_levels`, before `wrap_func_calls`. The transfer runs on the
  deep-copied env so the user's pristine `Function` schedule is not
  mutated.
- **`src/Serialization.cpp`** — `serialize_stage_schedule` now hard-errors
  if `implement_with_directives()` is non-empty, so the silent-drop
  behavior (still load-bearing — see Phase 1 notes) cannot regress
  unnoticed when serialization is enabled in some future build.
- **`src/CMakeLists.txt`** — new header + source registered in
  alphabetical position (`ApplyImplementWith` slots between
  `AllocationBoundsInference` and `ApplySplit`).
- **`test/correctness/implement_with_phase3.cpp`** (new) — 5 sub-tests
  covering: target-feature-missing error; target-feature-present
  compile success; user's pristine schedule untouched after compile;
  constant-extent conflict error; spec-input-name not present in user
  env is silently skipped (Phase 4's job).
- **`test/correctness/CMakeLists.txt`** — phase3 test registered.

### Scope decisions

Phase 3 v1 only transfers `FuncSchedule::bounds()` (the `Bound` list).
Other directive categories — `vectorize`, `align_storage`, `unroll`,
`reorder`, `compute_with` between spec Funcs — are recognized by the
design as transferable but require structural information about loop
nests that becomes available only after the matcher (Phase 4) maps spec
Vars to user split/reorder Vars. The Phase 3 hook still runs over all
spec Funcs, so layering more transfers on top is additive. See
[`DECISIONS.md`](DECISIONS.md#phase-3-scope-bounds-only-single-output)
for the rationale.

Multi-output instructions (Tuple-valued primaries and the `co_outputs`
overload) are *not* yet supported by the transfer pass: it errors
explicitly if `spec.outputs().size() != 1` or `co_output_names` is
non-empty. The reason is the same — multi-output mapping is naturally
name-keyed and benefits from the matcher's name-resolution.

### Resolved open questions

- **OQ#1 (target-feature check location)** — fires at lowering time
  (inside `apply_implement_with_directives`). The "opportunistic
  early-warning at construction time if Target is available" half of the
  design-doc proposal is **not** implemented in v1 — re-evaluate when
  generator integration lands.

### Tests

| Path                                                  | Status | Notes |
|-------------------------------------------------------|--------|-------|
| `test/correctness/implement_with_phase1.cpp`          | Passes | Unchanged. |
| `test/correctness/implement_with_phase2.cpp`          | Passes | Unchanged. |
| `test/correctness/implement_with_phase3.cpp`          | Passes | 5 sub-tests. Two error-path tests skip if exceptions disabled at runtime. |

---

## Phase 2 — what landed (session 2, 2026-05-25)

### Source changes (committed, 2 commits)

- **`src/Function.cpp`** / **`src/Function.h`** — `bool is_spec_pattern` in
  `FunctionContents`; deep-copy propagation; `Function::mark_as_spec_pattern()`
  and `Function::is_spec_pattern()` getter/setter.
- **`src/Pipeline.cpp`** — materialization guard at the top of
  `compile_to_module()`: errors with a clear message if any output Func is
  spec-pattern, before any other compile-path checks fire.
- **`src/Instruction.h`** — `Internal::in_spec_thunk()` declaration;
  updated `spec()` docstring; updated file-level phase comment.
- **`src/Instruction.cpp`** — thread-local `g_spec_thunk_depth` counter and
  `Internal::SpecThunkScope` RAII guard; `Instruction::spec()` now wraps the
  thunk call in this scope and marks all output Funcs spec-pattern after the
  thunk returns.
- **`src/Func.cpp`** — `FuncRef::operator Expr()` extended: when called inside
  a spec thunk for an undefined Func, auto-stubs the Func with a zero body
  (typed from `required_types` if set, `Int(32)` otherwise) so that downstream
  scheduling directives (`bound`, `vectorize`, etc.) can be applied.
- **`test/correctness/implement_with_phase1.cpp`** — stubs for `a`, `b`, `c`
  removed; constructors changed to `Func(Float(32), 1, "name")` to declare
  element types. Test still passes.
- **`test/correctness/implement_with_phase2.cpp`** (new) — five sub-tests.
- **`test/correctness/CMakeLists.txt`** — phase2 test registered.

### Design decision made under uncertainty

The design doc §3.3 example uses bare `Func a("a")` (no type annotation) for
undefined spec input Funcs.  Phase 2 requires explicit type declarations:
`Func(Float(32), 1, "a")`.  Bare `Func("a")` auto-stubs with `Int(32)`, which
may cause type mismatches in Phase 4's matcher.  Full type-polymorphic specs
are v2.  See [`DECISIONS.md`](DECISIONS.md#spec-input-func-type-declarations).

### Tests

| Path                                                  | Status | Notes |
|-------------------------------------------------------|--------|-------|
| `test/correctness/implement_with_phase1.cpp`          | Passes | Updated: stubs removed, typed Funcs. |
| `test/correctness/implement_with_phase2.cpp`          | Passes | 5 sub-tests. Exception path skipped if built without exceptions. |

---

## Phase 1 — what landed (session 1, 2026-05-25)

### Source changes (uncommitted)

- **`src/Instruction.h`** (new) — `Instruction`, `Instruction::Builder`,
  `MatchContext`, `ImplementMode`, and `Internal::ImplementWithDirective`.
- **`src/Instruction.cpp`** (new) — Builder validation and `Instruction`
  accessors. No matching/lowering logic; spec/emit callbacks are stored
  and callable but inert.
- **`src/Func.h`** — `#include "Instruction.h"`. Added
  `Stage::implement_with` and `Func::implement_with` (single + multi-output
  overloads).
- **`src/Func.cpp`** — implementations. `Stage::implement_with` records on
  `StageSchedule`; `Func::implement_with` delegates to the init `Stage`.
- **`src/Schedule.h`** — forward-decl `ImplementWithDirective`; added
  `implement_with_directives()` accessors on `StageSchedule`.
- **`src/Schedule.cpp`** — storage in `StageScheduleContents`; copied in
  `StageSchedule::get_copy()`.
- **`src/CMakeLists.txt`** — header + source lists updated.
- **`docs/implement_with/DESIGN.md`** (moved from
  `/var/home/alex/dev/Halide/implement_with_design.md`) — OQ#2 marked
  resolved; changelog appended; `require` vs `requires` noted.
- **`docs/implement_with/IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md`** (this file).
- **`docs/implement_with/DECISIONS.md`**.
- **`.gitignore`** — `docs/implement_with/SCRATCH.md`.

### Tests

| Path                                                  | Status | Notes |
|-------------------------------------------------------|--------|-------|
| `test/correctness/implement_with_phase1.cpp`          | Passes | 6 sub-tests: Builder happy path, init-stage recording, update-stage recording, multi-output co-output names, `StageSchedule::get_copy()` preservation, minimum-valid Builder. |

The test should be kept green by every subsequent phase. If a Phase N
change breaks it, fix the change — don't relax the test.

### Build

Verified with:

```
toolbox enter fedora-toolbox-43
# deps: cmake ninja-build gcc-c++ zlib-devel (one-time)
uv pip install --python .venv --index halide=https://pypi.halide-lang.org/simple \
    "halide-llvm~=23.0.0.dev0"
export Halide_LLVM_ROOT="$(./.venv/bin/halide-llvm --prefix)"
cmake -G Ninja -S . -B build/phase1 -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
    -DHalide_LLVM_ROOT="$Halide_LLVM_ROOT" \
    -DWITH_SERIALIZATION=OFF -DWITH_PYTHON_BINDINGS=OFF \
    -DWITH_TUTORIALS=OFF -DWITH_DOCS=OFF -DWITH_UTILS=OFF \
    -DWITH_AUTOSCHEDULERS=OFF -DHalide_WASM_BACKEND=OFF -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON
ninja -C build/phase1 -j $(nproc) correctness_implement_with_phase1
./build/phase1/test/correctness/correctness_implement_with_phase1
# → Success!
```

`WITH_SERIALIZATION=OFF` is load-bearing — see "Open issues" below.

### Resolved open questions

- **OQ#2 (spec-Func naming)** — explicit `Func("name")`. See
  [`DECISIONS.md`](DECISIONS.md#oq2-spec-func-naming).

### Decisions made under uncertainty

See [`DECISIONS.md`](DECISIONS.md). Highlights from session 1:
- Builder method named `require` (singular) instead of `requires`.
- `StageSchedule` got new storage rather than a side-table.
- Phase 1 doesn't touch `Function::Contents`; spec-pattern Func mode is
  deferred to Phase 2 as originally planned.

---

## Open issues / things to plan around

### Carried into Phase 4

- **Multi-output schedule transfer:** Phase 3 supports single-output
  only. Multi-output (`co_outputs`, Tuple-valued primaries) needs
  name-keyed spec→user mapping; cleanest to land alongside the matcher
  in Phase 4.
- **Non-bound directive transfer:** Phase 3 transfers only
  `FuncSchedule::bounds()`. The design contract also covers
  `vectorize`, `align_storage`, `unroll`, `reorder`, etc. These need
  the matcher's var rename to be useful at the user's split-Var level,
  so they layer naturally on Phase 4.

### Cross-cutting

- **Serialization:** Phase 3 added a hard error in
  `serialize_stage_schedule` if `implement_with_directives` is
  non-empty. `WITH_SERIALIZATION=OFF` is no longer load-bearing for
  the silent-drop reason, but is still load-bearing for the build —
  builds with serialization on will simply hard-error on any pipeline
  using `implement_with` until Phase 5+ adds proper serialization. See
  [DECISIONS.md](DECISIONS.md#serialization-hard-error-in-phase-3).

### Branching strategy

- All phases land on `alexreinking/implement_with` (single integration
  branch). Per-phase feature branches are *not* used.
- **Commits are PR-units.** The upstream workflow uses gh-stack (or
  similar) to turn each commit into its own PR, so each commit must
  stand on its own as a reviewable change. Split aggressively along
  natural seams: docs scaffolding separate from code, infrastructure
  separate from semantics, etc. Avoid mega-commits even when the
  phase is small.

---

## Session handoff — next session start here

1. **Continue Phase 4 — build the structural matcher.** The two
   matcher prerequisites are now in place (spec lowering +
   region locator); the matcher itself is the next PR. Suggested
   incremental landings:
   - **Define `MatchResult`** (`{ bool success; std::string
     failure_reason; std::map<std::string,std::string> var_rename;
     std::map<std::string,std::string> func_rename; }`) and the
     `match_canonical_form(spec_loop, user_loop) -> MatchResult`
     entry point in `ImplementWithMatcher.{h,cpp}`. Both inputs are
     the `For` nodes returned by `find_implement_with_loop` on the
     respective canonical Stmts.
   - **Alpha-renaming for Variables and LetStmt-bound names.**
     Parallel traversal that binds spec-name -> user-name on first
     sight and enforces consistency thereafter. Test: match a spec
     against a spec that was lowered with a different `Var()` name.
   - **Recognition of spec input Funcs as "match anything".** The
     spec's auto-stubbed input Funcs (Phase 2) appear as separate
     Produce/Consumer nodes in the spec's canonical Stmt with stub
     bodies (`= 0.0f`). The matcher must skip these and treat
     references to them as wildcards bound to the user's input
     Func names. This is where the structural matcher meets the
     bigger design.
   - **Commutativity for `+`, `*`, `min`, `max`** (and any other
     ops the case-study bodies actually need). Reuse `IRMatcher`
     from `src/IRMatch.h` if it fits.
   - **Simplify-equivalence for integer expressions** — call into
     `Simplify` to canonicalize indices/strides before comparing.
2. **Wire the matcher into `apply_implement_with_directives`.**
   Replace Phase 3's positional spec-Var -> user-Var rename with
   the matcher's `var_rename`. The Phase 3 tests should still pass
   (the 1D positional case is a degenerate matcher case); the win
   is correctness for multi-dim and split-renamed cases.
3. **Joint multi-output matching.** Extend the matcher to match
   against multiple co-computed outputs at the same loop level
   (Tuple primaries; `compute_with`-fused co-outputs). Lift the
   `co_output_names.empty()` and `outputs().size() == 1`
   restrictions in `apply_implement_with_directives`.
4. **Extend schedule transfer once the matcher provides a rename map.**
   Currently `ApplyImplementWith.cpp` transfers only
   `FuncSchedule::bounds()` and only single-output. Once the matcher
   gives us a proper var rename, layer in `align_storage`, `vectorize`
   (as a width requirement), and the multi-output path. Update Phase 3
   tests rather than the test file's filename — they should keep
   passing as Phase 4 lands.
5. **Tests for Phase 4:** the design's "get to end-to-end early"
   guidance (§8.1) has four case studies attached, each chosen to
   exercise a distinct property of the canonical-form prefix and the
   matcher:
   - `vfmadd231ps_256` (single FMA on AVX2/FMA — the canonical §3.3
     example) — simplest case; validates the post-FindIntrinsics
     match on a single intrinsic call.
   - SDOT 4×4 GEMV on ARM (§3.4 — multi-instruction emit) — tests
     joint matching of the four broadcasting SDOTs and multi-output
     scheduling.
   - HVX MAC sequences *or* AMX tile triples — validates that
     `find_intrinsics` (HVX) and (gated) `extract_tile_operations`
     (AMX) inside the prefix produce match-friendly canonical IR. At
     least one of these should be wired up; both is better.
   - PTX MMA on CUDA (NVPTX tensor cores) — validates LLVM-backed GPU
     matching. Canonical form is taken *before* `inject_gpu_offload`,
     so spec and use-site share `For::GPUBlock`/`For::GPUThread` loop
     structure; this is the test that closes the "LLVM-backed
     backends first" line from the OQ#5 analysis. Warp-scoped
     fragment IR also exercises shared-state subtleties that the CPU
     case studies cannot.
   The four together should be wired up before declaring OQ#5 "settled"
   beyond v1's no-stability-promise scope.

### What is NOT yet done that's worth noting

- The opportunistic *early-warning* target-feature check at
  `implement_with` call time (the second half of OQ#1's proposal) is
  not implemented. Consider it if generator workflows surface noisy
  late-error reports.
- The user's `MatchContext::input/output/param` accessors are still
  stubs — wired up in Phase 5 alongside emit substitution.
