    // Full inlining (the default schedule):
    // - Temporary memory allocated: 0
    // - Loads: 0
    // - Stores: 16
    // - Calls to sin: 64

    // producer.compute_root():
    // - Temporary memory allocated: 25 floats
    // - Loads: 64
    // - Stores: 41
    // - Calls to sin: 25

    // There's a trade-off here. Full inlining used minimal temporary
    // memory and memory bandwidth, but did a whole bunch of redundant
    // expensive math (calling sin). It evaluated most points in
    // 'producer' four times. The second schedule,
    // producer.compute_root(), did the mimimum number of calls to
    // sin, but used more temporary memory and more memory bandwidth.

    // In any given situation the correct choice can be difficult to
    // make. If you're memory-bandwidth limited, or don't have much
    // memory (e.g. because you're running on an old cell-phone), then
    // it can make sense to do redundant math. On the other hand, sin
    // is expensive, so if you're compute-limited then fewer calls to
    // sin will make your program faster. Adding vectorization or
    // multi-core parallelism tilts the scales in favor of doing
    // redundant work, because firing up multiple cpu cores increases
    // the amount of math you can do per second, but doesn't increase
    // your system memory bandwidth or capacity.

    // We can make choices in between full inlining and
    // compute_root. Next we'll alternate between computing the
    // producer and consumer on a per-scanline basis:
    {
        // Start with the same function definitions:

    // The answer is parallelism. In both of the previous two
    // strategies we've assumed that values computed in previous
    // iterations are lying around for us to reuse. This assumes that
    // previous values of x or y happened earlier in time and have
    // finished. This is not true if you parallelize or vectorize
    // either loop. Darn. If you parallelize, Halide won't inject the
    // optimizations that skip work already done if there's a parallel
    // loop in between the store_at level and the compute_at level,
    // and won't fold the storage down into a circular buffer either,
    // which makes our store_root pointless.

    // We're running out of options. We can make new ones by
    // splitting. We can store_at or compute_at at the natural
    // variables of the consumer (x and y), or we can split x or y
    // into new inner and outer sub-variables and then schedule with
    // respect to those. We'll use this to express fusion in tiles:
