HelloPytorch is a simple application that demonstrates how to build a
PyTorch wrapper around Halide ops using the internal Generator target.

The demo op takes two 4D tensors as input, `a` and `b` and outputs their
pointwise sum.

The application builds float32 and float64 versions of the op for CPU and CUDA
(provided that a GPU is present and the `nvcc` compiler is installed and in the
path, see `Makefile`).

The build proceeds in four steps:
1. Build the Halide generator
2. Build Halide code for each each datatype and each architecture (`-e
   static_library,h` flag in the generator). 
3. Build the PyTorch C++ interface code (`-e pytorch_wrapper` flag in the
   generator). Note that the PyTorch wrapper requires the `user_context`
   feature be enabled in the generator `target` for CUDA ops. This allows Halide's and
   PyTorch's GPU memory managers to communicate with each other.
4. Synthesize and compile a Python extension that links togethers the various
   operator libraries and exposes them to Python (see `setup.py`).

Building only requires Python 3 and PyTorch. Please follow these instructions to
install the latest PyTorch:

If everything is setup correctly, running `make test` should build the PyTorch
extension and runs a simple test (`test.py`).

Tested with Python 3.7.4 and PyTorch 1.2.0
