HelloHalide is a simple application which applies a tone curve and
sharpening to a video preview from the camera on a phone or tablet.

This application builds for multiple native ABIs. (At present armeabi,
armeabi-v7a, arm64-v8a, mips, x86_64, and x86 are supported. mips64 is
not presently working.) Halide code is generated for each architecture.

This build is meant to use Android command line tools. (An IDE is not
required.) In order to build, the following will be required:

*Android NDK -- This can be downloaded here:
    https://developer.android.com/tools/sdk/ndk/index.html
After installing, make sure the top-level directory of the install is
in the PATH. (It should contain an executable ndk-build file.)

*Android SDK -- This can be downloaded here:
    http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html
The standalone SDK is desired. Once downloaded, the "android" program
in the tools directory of the install will need to be run. It should
bring up a UI allowing one to choose components to
install. HelloAndroid currently depends on the android-17 release. (It
can easily be made to run on others, but that is what the scripts are
setup to build against.) Make sure the tools directory is on one's
PATH.

*Apache Ant -- which can be downloaded here:
    http://ant.apache.org/bindownload.cgi
make sure the bin directory is on one's PATH.

If everything is setup correctly, running the build.sh script in this
directory, with the current directory set to here, whould build the
HelloAndroid apk and install it on a connected Android device.

Gradle
===
To use Gradle create local.properties file in this folder with sdk.dir and
ndk.dir variables defined like so:
```
sdk.dir=/Users/joe/Downloads/android-sdk
ndk.dir=/Users/joe/Downloads/android-ndk
```
After that run ```gradlew build``` which will produce .apk file ready for
deployment to the Android device.

On Linux/Mac you can use ```build-gradle.sh``` to build, deploy and run
this sample application.

Pay attention to the list of platforms supported by your Halide installation.
They are listed in jni/Application.mk APP_ABI variable
and in build.gradle archs map. For example, if your Halide installation was
built without mips support or without arm64-v8a, remove them from APP_ABI and
archs. Both list and map should match, otherwise you will be getting compilation
errors complaining about a missing halide_generated.h file:

```
:compileDebugNdkClassic FAILED

FAILURE: Build failed with an exception.

* What went wrong:
Execution failed for task ':compileDebugNdkClassic'.
...
  Output:
    /private/tmp/7/halide/apps/HelloAndroid/jni/native.cpp:9:30: fatal error: halide_generated.h: No such file or directory
     #include "halide_generated.h"

```

Android Studio
===
To load project into Android Studio use "File/Import Project..." in
Android Studio and point to apps/HelloAndroid/build.gradle file.

You will have to edit automatically-generated local.properties file to add
ndk.dir property so it points to your Android NDK installation as described
in Gradle section above.
