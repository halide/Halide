HelloAndroidCamera2 is a simple application which uses Halide to
process images streamed from the Android camera2 API. It reads every
frame into the CPU via an ImageReader and uses Halide to either blit
the frame to the output surface (converting between YUV formats), or
apply an edge detector on the luma channel. This example requires a
phone or tablet that supports the camera2 API (Android API level 21 or
above). This sample has been tested on Nexus 5, Nexus 6 and Nexus 9.

CAVEAT: This example uses the not-so-well-documented ANativeWindow C
API to directly write into the graphics buffers that support the Java
"Surface" and "SurfaceView" classes. In particular, we rely on the
YV12 format and use the ANativeWindow API to "reconfigure" buffers so
that they do not have to match the resolution of the display. This
exploits the hardware scaler to resample the displayed image. However,
although camera2 reports a set of supported resolutions for
ImageReader, there is no such enumeration for the display. On untested
devices, chooseOptimalSize() may return camera resolution for which
there is no matching graphics resolution. This will lead to a green
screen with a logcat error message that looks something like:

E/halide_native( 6146): ANativeWindow buffer locked but its size was
1920 x 1440, expected 1440 x 1080

This application builds for multiple native ABIs. (At present armeabi,
armeabi-v7a, arm64-v8a, mips, x86_64, and x86 are supported. mips64 is
not presently working.) Halide code is generated for each
architecture.

This build is meant to use Android command line tools. (An IDE is not
required.) In order to build, the following will be required:

*Android NDK -- This can be downloaded here:
    https://developer.android.com/tools/sdk/ndk/index.html
After installing, make sure the top-level directory of the install is
in the PATH. (It should contain an executable ndk-build file.)

*Android SDK -- This can be downloaded here:
    http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html

The standalone SDK is desired. Once downloaded, the "android" program
in the tools directory of the install will need to be run. It should
bring up a UI allowing one to choose components to install.
HelloAndroidCamera2 currently depends on the android-21 release.  Make
sure the tools directory is on one's PATH.

*Apache Ant -- which can be downloaded here:
    http://ant.apache.org/bindownload.cgi
make sure the bin directory is on one's PATH.

If everything is setup correctly, running the build.sh script in this
directory, with the current directory set to here, whould build the
HelloAndroidCamera2 apk and install it on a connected Android device.

Gradle
===
To use Gradle create local.properties file in this folder with sdk.dir and
ndk.dir variables defined like so:
```
sdk.dir=/Users/joe/Downloads/android-sdk
ndk.dir=/Users/joe/Downloads/android-ndk
```
After that run ```gradlew build``` which will produce .apk file ready for
deployment to the Android device.

On Linux/Mac you can use ```build-gradle.sh``` to build, deploy and run
this sample application.

Pay attention to the list of platforms supported by your Halide installation.
They are listed in jni/Application.mk APP_ABI variable
and in build.gradle archs map. For example, if your Halide installation was
built without mips support or without arm64-v8a, remove them from APP_ABI and
archs. Both list and map should match, otherwise you will be getting compilation
errors complaining about a missing halide_generated.h file:

```
:ndkBuild FAILED

FAILURE: Build failed with an exception.

* What went wrong:
Execution failed for task ':ndkBuild'.
...
  Output:
    /private/tmp/7/halide/apps/HelloAndroidCamera2/jni/native.cpp:11:26: fatal error: deinterleave.h: No such file or directory
     #include "deinterleave.h"

```

Android Studio
===
To load project into Android Studio use "File/Import Project..." in
Android Studio and point to apps/HelloAndroidCamera2/build.gradle file.

You will have to edit automatically-generated local.properties file to add
ndk.dir property so it points to your Android NDK installation as described
in Gradle section above.
