# x86 / CUDA log

## Phase 0: environment and gate

Machine: Xeon w5-2455X (Sapphire Rapids, 12C/24T: AVX-512, VNNI, BF16, FP16,
AMX), RTX A4500 (sm_86), WSL2 Ubuntu 24.04, CUDA 13.2, LLVM 22. GGML 0.26.0 via
`apps/vcpkg` with the `cuda` feature (native ISA incl. AMX, CPU repack,
`GGML_LLAMAFILE=OFF`, CUDA for the native arch).

Gate: `ggml-quant-bench --check`: 2276 results, 0 failures (468 vec_dot,
1164 mul_mat, 644 codec; 1900 Halide rows, 376 GGML rows incl. 108 ggml-cuda
across mmvq/mmq/mmvf/mmf/cuBLAS and 24 ggml-cpu-amx). `ctest`: 11/11 pass.

Core fixes:

- `ExtractTileOperations`: the AMX pass rewrote `Tile` allocations inside GPU
  kernels (wmma); it now leaves GPU kernels alone.
- `Parameter`: a struct buffer's default host alignment was the struct's size
  (e.g. 64 bytes), which let x86 codegen emit aligned 64-byte loads on
  2-byte-aligned records and fault; it is now the struct's alignment.
- CUDA runtime: dlopen `libcuda.so.1` first; WSL ships only the soname.

App fixes:

- `blocked()` vectors are capped at 16 bytes (records are not over-aligned).
- `--probe-gpu`: CUDA kernel attribution in a child process via CUPTI.
- Schemes' `a*b+c` in GGML's reference quantizers rounds as GGML's build does:
  `ggml-base` is built for the baseline ISA, which on x86-64 has no FMA, so it
  is unfused there (fused on arm64). Without this, q6_K's scales differ by one.
- GGML's AMX buffer runs f16 on AVX-512 (no repack); labelled `amx:f16(avx512)`.

Known, unrelated: core `correctness_constant_blob_placement` segfaults in
libstdc++'s `std::regex` (recursion depth), before and after these changes.
