// Attention over a batch of queries, with nothing leaving the tensor core
// registers between the two matrix multiplies: Q.K' gives a row of scores per
// query, a softmax normalises each row, and the result of that is fed straight
// into a second multiply against V as its a operand.
//
// The point of keeping it in registers is what it does not do. The scores are
// a queries x keys matrix, far larger than the output, and writing them out
// and reading them back is what an unfused attention spends its time on. Here
// they are only ever a tensor core accumulator, so the traffic is Q, K and V
// in and the output out, and the softmax reductions happen where the fragments
// already sit, by the lanes of a warp exchanging entries along a row.
//
// A block holds one group of rows and all the keys, because the softmax
// reduces along a row and a row has to be whole to reduce it. That bounds how
// many keys this can do at once - flash attention's trick of walking the keys
// in chunks and rescaling as it goes is what lifts that, and is not done here.

//
// The last column is cublas doing only the two multiplies, into and out of a
// scores matrix in global memory, with no softmax at all. It does less
// arithmetic than this filter, so the first and third rows being twice as fast
// is what a matrix multiply that doesn't stop to do anything else looks like.
//
// The middle row is the interesting one. Doubling the keys doubles the scores
// matrix, which is what cublas has to write and read back, and it drops to
// less than half the speed of the other two rows while this filter gets
// faster. Past that shape the traffic in the scores is what an unfused
// attention spends its time on, and not having any is what this is for.
//
// The exponential is not worth economising on here. Halide's fast_exp measured
// the same to within noise at every shape above, because the kernel issues one
// exponential per score against depth + out_depth multiply-accumulates per
// score across the two multiplies.
