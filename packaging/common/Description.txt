 Halide is a programming language designed to make it easier to write
 high-performance image and array processing code on modern machines. Halide
 currently targets:

 * CPU architectures: X86, ARM, Hexagon, PowerPC, RISC-V, WebAssembly
 * Operating systems: Linux, Windows, macOS, Android, iOS, Qualcomm QuRT
 * GPU APIs: CUDA, OpenCL, OpenGL Compute Shaders, Apple Metal, Direct X 12

Rather than being a standalone programming language, Halide is embedded in C++.
This means you write C++ code that builds an in-memory representation of a
Halide pipeline using Halide's C++ API. You can then compile this representation
to an object file, or JIT-compile it and run it in the same process.
