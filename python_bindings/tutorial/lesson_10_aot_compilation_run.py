# This is the code that actually uses the Halide pipeline we've
# compiled. It does not depend on libHalide, so we won't be including
# Halide.h.
#
# Instead, it depends on the header file that lesson_10_generate
# produced when we ran it:
#include "lesson_10_halide.h"

#include <stdio.h>

    # It starts with a definition of a buffer_t:

    #     uint64_t dev
    #     uint8_t* host
    #     int32_t extent[4]

    #
    # This is how Halide represents input and output images in
    # pre-compiled pipelines. There's a 'host' pointer that points to the
    # start of the image data, some fields that describe how to access
    # pixels, and some fields related to using the GPU that we'll ignore
    # for now (dev, host_dirty, dev_dirty).
