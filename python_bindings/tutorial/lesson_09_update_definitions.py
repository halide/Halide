# Halide tutorial lesson 9

# This lesson demonstrates how to define a hl.Func in multiple passes, including scattering.

# This lesson can be built by invoking the command:
#    make tutorial_lesson_09_update_definitions
# in a shell with the current directory at the top of the halide source tree.
# Otherwise, see the platform-specific compiler invocations below.

# On linux, you can compile and run it like so:
# g++ lesson_09*.cpp -g -std=c++11 -I ../include -L ../bin -lHalide `libpng-config --cflags --ldflags` -lpthread -ldl -fopenmp -o lesson_09
# LD_LIBRARY_PATH=../bin ./lesson_09

# On os x (will only work if you actually have g++, not Apple's pretend g++ which is actually clang):
# g++ lesson_09*.cpp -g -std=c++11 -I ../include -L ../bin -lHalide `libpng-config --cflags --ldflags` -fopenmp -o lesson_09
# DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=../bin ./lesson_09

    # You can define a hl.Func in multiple passes. Let's see a toy
    # example first.
    if True:
        # The first definition must be one like we have seen already
        # - a mapping from Vars to an hl.Expr:
        f = hl.Func("f")
        f[x, y] = x + y
        # We call this first definition the "pure" definition.

        # But the later definitions can include computed expressions on
        # both sides. The simplest example is modifying a single point:
        f[3, 7] = 42

        # We call these extra definitions "update" definitions, or
        # "reduction" definitions. A reduction definition is an
        # update definition that recursively refers back to the
        # function's current value at the same site:
        if False:
            e = f[x, y] + 17
            print("f[x, y] + 17", e)
            print("(f[x, y] + 17).type()", e.type())
            print("(f[x, y]).type()", f[x,y].type())

        f[x, y] = f[x, y] + 17

        # If we confine our update to a single row, we can
        # recursively refer to values in the same column:
        f[x, 3] = f[x, 0] * f[x, 10]

        # Similarly, if we confine our update to a single column, we
        # can recursively refer to other values in the same row.
        f[0, y] = f[0, y] / f[3, y]

        # The general rule is: Each hl.Var used in an update definition
        # must appear unadorned in the same position as in the pure
        # definition in all references to the function on the left-
        # and right-hand sides. So the following definitions are
        # legal updates:
        f[x, 17] = x + 8 # x is used, so all uses of f must have x as the first argument.
        f[0, y] = y * 8  # y is used, so all uses of f must have y as the second argument.
        f[x, x + 1] = x + 8
        f[y/2, y] = f[0, y] * 17

        # But these ones would cause an error:
        # f[x, 0) = f[x + 1, 0) <- First argument to f on the right-hand-side must be 'x', not 'x + 1'.
        # f[y, y + 1) = y + 8   <- Second argument to f on the left-hand-side must be 'y', not 'y + 1'.
        # f[y, x) = y - x      <- Arguments to f on the left-hand-side are in the wrong places.
        # f[3, 4) = x + y      <- Free variables appear on the right-hand-side but not the left-hand-side.

        # We'll realize this one just to make sure it compiles. The
        # second-to-last definition forces us to realize over a
        # domain that is taller than it is wide.
        f.realize(100, 101)

        # For each realization of f, each step runs in its entirety
        # before the next one begins. Let's trace the loads and
        # stores for a simpler example:
        g = hl.Func("g")
        g[x, y] = x + y   # Pure definition
        g[2, 1] = 42      # First update definition
        g[x, 0] = g[x, 1] # Second update definition

        g.trace_loads()
        g.trace_stores()

        g.realize(4, 4)

        # Reading the log, we see that each pass is applied in turn. The equivalent C is:
        result = np.empty( (4,4), dtype=np.int)
        # Pure definition
        for yy in range(4):
            for xx in range(4):
                result[yy][xx] = xx + yy


        # First update definition
        result[1][2] = 42
        # Second update definition
        for xx in range(4):
            result[0][xx] = result[1][xx]

    # Putting update passes inside loops.
    if True:
        # Starting with this pure definition:
        f = hl.Func("f")
        f[x, y] = x + y

        # Say we want an update that squares the first fifty rows. We
        # could do this by adding 50 update definitions:

        # f[x, 0) = f[x, 0) * f[x, 0)
        # f[x, 1) = f[x, 1) * f[x, 1)
        # f[x, 2) = f[x, 2) * f[x, 2)
        # ...
        # f[x, 49) = f[x, 49) * f[x, 49)

        # Or equivalently using a compile-time loop in our C++:
        # for (int i = 0 i < 50 i++) {
        #   f[x, i) = f[x, i) * f[x, i)
        #

        # But it's more manageable and more flexible to put the loop
        # in the generated code. We do this by defining a "reduction
        # domain" and using it inside an update definition:
        r = hl.RDom([(0, 50)])
        f[x, r] = f[x, r] * f[x, r]
