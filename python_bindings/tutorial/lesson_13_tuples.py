# Halide tutorial lesson 13: Tuples

# This lesson describes how to write Funcs that evaluate to multiple
# values.

# On linux, you can compile and run it like so:
# g++ lesson_13*.cpp -g -I ../include -L ../bin -lHalide -lpthread -ldl -o lesson_13 -std=c++11
# LD_LIBRARY_PATH=../bin ./lesson_13

# On os x:
# g++ lesson_13*.cpp -g -I ../include -L ../bin -lHalide -o lesson_13 -std=c++11
# DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=../bin ./lesson_13

# If you have the entire Halide source tree, you can also build it by
# running:
#    make tutorial_lesson_13_tuples
# in a shell with the current directory at the top of the halide
# source tree.

def main():

    # So far Funcs (such as the one below) have evaluated to a single
    # scalar value for each point in their domain.
    single_valued = Func()
    x, y = Var("x"), Var("y")
    single_valued[x, y] = x + y

    # One way to write a Func that returns a collection of values is
    # to add an additional dimension which indexes that
    # collection. This is how we typically deal with color. For
    # example, the Func below represents a collection of three values
    # for every x, y coordinate indexed by c.
    color_image = Func()
    c = Var("c")
    color_image[x, y, c] = select(c == 0, 245, # Red value
                                  c == 1, 42,  # Green value
                                  132)        # Blue value

    # This method is often convenient because it makes it easy to
    # operate on this Func in a way that treats each item in the
    # collection equally:
    brighter = Func()
    brighter[x, y, c] = color_image[x, y, c] + 10

    # However this method is also inconvenient for three reasons.
    #
    # 1) Funcs are defined over an infinite domain, so users of this
    # Func can for example access color_image(x, y, -17), which is
    # not a meaningful value and is probably indicative of a bug.
    #
    # 2) It requires a select, which can impact performance if not
    # bounded and unrolled:
    # brighter.bound(c, 0, 3).unroll(c)
    #
    # 3) With this method, all values in the collection must have the
    # same type. While the above two issues are merely inconvenient,
    # this one is a hard limitation that makes it impossible to
    # express certain things in this way.

    # It is also possible to represent a collection of values as a
    # collection of Funcs:
    func_array = [Func() for i in range(3)]
    func_array[0][x, y] = x + y
    func_array[1][x, y] = sin(x)
    func_array[2][x, y] = cos(y)

    # This method avoids the three problems above, but introduces a
    # new annoyance. Because these are separate Funcs, it is
    # difficult to schedule them so that they are all computed
    # together inside a single loop over x, y.

    # A third alternative is to define a Func as evaluating to a
    # Tuple instead of an Expr. A Tuple is a fixed-size collection of
    # Exprs which may have different type. The following function
    # evaluates to an integer value (x+y), and a floating point value
    # (sin(x*y)).
    multi_valued = Func("multi_valued")
    multi_valued[x, y] = Tuple(x + y, sin(x * y))

    # Realizing a tuple-valued Func returns a collection of
    # Buffers. We call this a Realization. It's equivalent to a
    # std::vector of Buffer/Image objects:
    if True:
        r = multi_valued.realize(80, 60)
        assert r.size() == 2
        im1 = Image(Int(32), r[0])
        im2 = Image(Float(32), r[1])
        assert type(im1) is Image_int32
        assert type(im2) is Image_float32
        assert im1(30, 40) == 30 + 40
        assert numpy.isclose(im2(30, 40), math.sin(30 * 40))


    # All Tuple elements are evaluated together over the same domain
    # in the same loop nest, but stored in distinct allocations. The
    # equivalent C++ code to the above is:
    if True:
        multi_valued_0 = numpy.empty((80*60), dtype=numpy.int32)
        multi_valued_1 = numpy.empty((80*60), dtype=numpy.int32)

                multi_valued_1[xx + 60*yy] = math.sin(xx*yy)


    # When compiling ahead-of-time, a Tuple-valued Func evaluates
    # into multiple distinct output buffer_t structs. These appear in
    # order at the end of the function signature:
    # int multi_valued(...input buffers and params..., buffer_t *output_1, buffer_t *output_2)

    # You can construct a Tuple by passing multiple Exprs to the
    # Tuple constructor as we did above. Perhaps more elegantly, you
    # can also take advantage of C++11 initializer lists and just
    # enclose your Exprs in braces:
    multi_valued_2 = Func("multi_valued_2")
    #multi_valued_2(x, y) = {x + y, sin(x*y)}
    multi_valued_2[x, y] = Tuple(x + y, sin(x * y))

    # Calls to a multi-valued Func cannot be treated as Exprs. The
    # following is a syntax error:
    # Func consumer
    # consumer[x, y] = multi_valued_2[x, y] + 10

    # Instead you must index a Tuple with square brackets to retrieve
    # the individual Exprs:
    integer_part = multi_valued_2[x, y][0]
    floating_part = multi_valued_2[x, y][1]
    assert type(integer_part) is Expr
    assert type(floating_part) is Expr

    if True:
        # Tuples are particularly useful in reductions, as they allow
