## PYBIND TODO:

- There is (apparently?) no way to override the logical "and" and "or" operators in Python to work with Expr; you must use the bitwise | and & instead. Worse, using the logical operators just short-circuits weirdly; it would be nice if we could at least make using and/or with Expr an error.
- BoundaryConditions isn't in a sub-name. Should it be?
- minimize Py dependencies in tests. (scipy?)
- All docstrings have been removed; if we re-add them, we should find a way to import them from Doxygen output to ensure they are fresh.
- Tutorials are incomplete and need lots of love.
- Many error messages need to be made more informative. Many exceptions are of incorrect type.

- Wrappers Missing Entirely:
    - ConciseCasts
    - DeviceInterface
    - evaluate()
    - Float16 [possible via numpy?]
    - Generator
    - Module
    - Outputs
    - Pipeline
- Wrappers Incomplete, Tests Incomplete:
    - Func
    - ParamMap
- Wrappers Believed To Be Complete, But Tests Incomplete:
    - Buffer
    - ExternFuncArgument
    - FuncRef
    - FuncTupleElementRef
    - ImageParam
    - InlineReductions
    - IROperator
    - LoopLevel
    - OutputImageParam
    - RDom
    - RVar
    - Stage
- Wrappers Complete, Tests Complete:
    - BoundaryConditions
    - Expr
    - Target
    - Type
    - Var
