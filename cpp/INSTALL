Dependencies
------------------------------------------------------------------

Building halide requires llvm 3.2, along with the matching version of
clang. llvm-config and clang must be somewhere in the path. If your OS
does not have packages for llvm-3.2, you can find binaries for it at
http://llvm.org/releases/download.html. Download an appropriate
package and then either install it, or at least put the bin
subdirectory in your path. (This works well on OS X and Ubuntu.)

If you want to build it yourself, first check it out from subversions:

svn co https://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/llvm/branches/release_32 llvm3.2
svn co https://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/cfe/branches/release_32 llvm3.2/tools/clang

Then build it like so:

cd llvm3.2
./configure --enable-optimized --with-clang
make -j8

Then finally put it in the path like so:

export PATH=<path to llvm3.2>/Release+Asserts/bin:$PATH

Newer versions of llvm may also work. Support for these is
experimental.

Building Halide
------------------------------------------------------------------

With llvm-config and clang in your path, you should be able to just
run 'make' in this directory. 'make tests' will run the JIT test
suite, and 'make test_apps' will make sure all the apps compile and
run (but won't check their output).

There is no 'make install' or 'make distrib' yet. If you want to make
an install package, grab bin/libHalide.a and bin/libHalide.so, and all
the header files in src.
